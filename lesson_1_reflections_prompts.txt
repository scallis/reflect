What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    automatic saves can be confusing with small changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git thinks documents can be related, others don't

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all the changes on the file with a SAH id 
    git diff shows differences with two versions two different SHA id 
    +s shows added lines in green
    -s shows removed lines in red

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can switch between the versions in order to find out where the problem is
